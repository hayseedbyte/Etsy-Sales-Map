# Wildbot Etsy Sales Map

The Wildbot Sales Map allows you to upload CSV files of your orders from Etsy. A marker is placed everywhere you've shipped an order.

## Usage

- Login in to Etsy Shop Manager.
- Go to Settings > Options > Download Data.
- Under "CSV TYPE" choose "ORDERS".
- Pick the Year you want to map
- To get all the orders for that year, leave the month blank

If you want to map all your orders, and you've been selling on Etsy for multiple years, you'll have to download a separate CSV for each year.

To show your orders on the map, click **_Upload CSV Files_** and hold down CTRL to select multiple files. Once you've selected all your csv files from Etsy, click **_open_**.

Finally, click **_Submit_** and your markers will show up on the map.

You can click the printer icon in the top right corner of the map to download an image of your map.

For performance reasons it only generates one marker per state/province in the US and Canada and only one marker per country for everywhere else. However, you can click on a marker and it will show how many orders you've shipped to that area.

Total orders are displayed at the top.
